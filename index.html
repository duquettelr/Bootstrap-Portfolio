            </p>

            In 2013 I graduated from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Health
            Sciences.
            I then attended Northeastern University for graduate school where I earned a professional doctoral
            degree
            in Physical Therapy. Post-graduation, I worked in the field of physical therapy for two years but
            did
            not
            feel fulfilled by my career. The aspects of my job that I enjoyed the most included working with
            technology
            and software, which sparked my interest in computer science.

            At that point, I began taking night courses at schools including Boston University and Quincy
            College to
            learn
            more about software development. After approximately one year of taking courses and learning various
            programming
            languages on my own including Python, C and SQL I accepted a position working as a Quality Assurance
            Engineer. Through
            this program at Harvard Extension School I hope to eventually earn a position working as a front-end
            developer.
